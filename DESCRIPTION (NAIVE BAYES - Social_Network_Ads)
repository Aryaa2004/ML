A COMPANY WANTS TO RUN A MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO INCREASE THE SALES OF THEIR SUV CARS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL DATA PRESENT WITH THEM CONTAINING COLUMNS "AGE", "SALARY", "PURCHASED".
I HAVE CREATED A NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFICATION MODEL ON A SUV CAR SALES DATASET TO PREDICT WHETHER THE CUSTOMER BOUGHT THE SUV OR NOT BASED ON THEIR AGE AND ESTIMATED SALARY. FROM THIS MODEL, WE CAN COME TO KNOW WHAT AGE 
FROUP OF PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WITH HOW  MUCH APPROXIAMTE SALARY HAVE BOUGHT THE SUV CARS IN THE PAST AND WITH THIS INSIGHT THE COMPANY CAN TARGET THOSE CUSTOMERS WITH THEIR MARKETING CAMPAIGN.
